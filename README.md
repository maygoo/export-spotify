# export-spotify
Exports all the songs associated with an account. Meaning all the songs liked by a user, all the songs in playlists followed by the user, and all songs in albums liked by the user.

Outputs in some format I haven't decided yet. Probably just CSV. Also able to save the full track data (with all the info as given by spotify) in a python pickle file for easier user in other projects.
